# Delivery workflow

Axis is built through NexKit. NexKit runs one issue per agent session. People
drive it with four comment commands: `/nexkit plan` and `/nexkit go` on an
issue, and `/nexkit fix` and `/nexkit review` on its pull request.

Three roles take part:

- **The owner** decides. The owner approves plans, and chooses whether NexKit
  merges its own pull requests or the owner merges each one.
- **The local agent session** drives NexKit for the owner. It posts commands,
  reads plans and triages pull requests.
- **NexKit's agents** plan, implement, fix and review inside the NexKit
  pipeline. They read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

The rules here put [D13](decisions.md#d13-delivery-workflow--agreed) into
practice. Values that NexKit or the repository settings own, such as protected
paths, required checks, the automatic fix limit and the profiles with their
models, are not copied here. Look them up where they live.

## Decisions

- **The local agent may post `/nexkit plan`, `/nexkit fix` and
  `/nexkit review` itself.** It posts `/nexkit go` only when the owner says so
  explicitly.
- **NexKit merges a pull request once it passes, while `auto_merge` is on.**
  With NexKit's [`auto_merge` setting][nexkit-auto-merge] on, NexKit
  squash-merges a pull request as soon as every check passes and the AI review
  approves. The owner turns it off to decide each merge again, and then only
  the owner merges. The switch is in `.nexkit/`, so changing it is a hand-made
  pull request.
- **The rules on `main` let NexKit merge.** They require NexKit's own checks
  and no approval from a person. They do not require the CI workflow, which
  runs on pushes to `main` and to hand-made branches but not on NexKit's
  branches. NexKit's checks run the same scripts there.
- **CI runs on `main` after every merge.** A merge by NexKit starts no `push`
  workflow, so NexKit starts the CI workflow on `main` itself, through its
  `after_merge_workflows` setting. Two pull requests that pass on their own
  can still break `main` together. When CI on `main` fails, the local agent
  runs it once more if the failure looks flaky. Otherwise it tells the owner
  and opens a bug issue with the failure, which goes before other issues.
- **NexKit's checks skip smoke tests that a change cannot affect.** The
  `scripts/dev.sh` and Docker Compose smoke tests take about 4 of the 9 minutes
  of checks. NexKit sets `NEXKIT_BASE_SHA`, the commit the pull request started
  from. A smoke test is skipped only when that variable is set, git can list the
  changed and untracked files, and none of them is on the test's path list. The
  lists are in [`scripts/lib/affected.mjs`](../scripts/lib/affected.mjs). Any
  doubt runs the test. CI sets no base, so CI on `main` always runs both. The
  test summary lists a skipped suite as skipped.
- **Everything goes through NexKit, except changes in paths NexKit may not
  change.** Those paths are set by NexKit's
  [`protected_paths` setting][nexkit-config].
  Such changes are hand-made pull requests on any branch name, for example a
  NexKit version bump. The owner opens them from their own account. NexKit's
  checks do not run on them, so the owner merges them with an admin bypass of
  the rules on `main`, after the CI workflow passes.

## Profiles

Each issue runs on one NexKit profile. The profile sets the models for the
plan, implement, fix and review rounds of that issue. When `/nexkit plan`
starts, NexKit's triage step reads the issue and chooses the profile. The
profiles, their `when` texts and their models are in NexKit's
[`profiles` setting][nexkit-profiles]. This section holds the rules behind
them.

- **Profiles go by risk: `standard` and `hard`.** The more a mistake would
  cost, the stronger the profile. `standard` is the default.
- **Plan and review are at least as strong as implement.** The plan is the
  contract and the review is the last check before the owner. In every
  profile, review runs on a different model from implement.
- **Triage runs on a strong model.** It is one call that reads only the
  issue, so it costs little, and a wrong choice does not fail: the issue just
  runs on the wrong profile.
- **A `when` text says what a mistake would cost, not where the code is.** It
  may name concepts from [concepts.md](domain/concepts.md) as examples, but
  never files, classes, doc sections or milestones, which go stale. `hard` is
  broad and `standard` is the rest. When unsure, triage chooses the stronger
  profile.
- **Triage sees only the issue and its discussion.** It does not open links.
  So an issue names the concepts it touches in its own text, even when it
  links to the docs that describe them.
- **A comment changes the profile.** Comment
  `/nexkit plan Use the <profile> profile`. A request written in the issue
  text does not count. A re-plan keeps the profile unless someone asks for
  another one.
- **Profile changes are hand-made pull requests,** because `.nexkit/` is a
  path NexKit may not change.

## The life of an issue

1. **Write the issue.** One issue is one behaviour, aiming for 2–5 acceptance
   criteria that a test or command can check. More than five is a signal to
   check whether the issue holds more than one behaviour. If it does, split it.
   If every criterion checks the same behaviour, more are fine. A plan is not
   revised only to cut the number of criteria. It links to the doc sections it
   implements and is in the current milestone. Its text names the concepts it
   touches, so triage can choose the [profile](#profiles).
2. **Plan.** Comment `/nexkit plan` on the issue. NexKit's plan agent posts a
   plan as a comment.
3. **Review the plan.** Check it against [decisions.md](decisions.md), and
   never treat a **Proposed** decision as **Agreed**. Check the profile and
   the reason shown in the plan comment. If the profile is wrong, comment
   `/nexkit plan Use the <profile> profile`. If a `when` text caused the
   wrong choice, fix that text in a hand-made pull request. Any change agreed after
   the plan is posted, whether the review finds a gap or the owner decides
   something while approving, however small, is commented in the same issue
   and `/nexkit plan` is run again before `/nexkit go`. A re-plan revises the
   latest plan. It keeps what no newer comment asks to change, and its *Since
   the last plan* section lists what changed. So a review comment states only
   the changes. Write each one tersely, on one short line, with the exact
   values, names and rules, and drop reasons and prose. The reasons are in the
   plan and the docs. Do not repeat what the issue or the merged docs already
   say. Link to the doc instead. For example:
   `Change: limits 2,000 chars / depth 32 / 500 nodes; == null-safe; trim not in SQL.`
   Check the *Since the last plan* section against those comments. A note such
   as `/nexkit plan from scratch` plans again without the latest plan's
   choices. Use it only when the plan has gone wrong, and then comment every
   choice to keep first. `/nexkit go`
   only runs on the latest plan, and that plan holds every agreed change. The reason:
   the plan is the contract. It holds the acceptance criteria the pull request
   is checked against, and it is the record a later reader looks at. A change
   that lives only in a comment is missing from both. Re-planning also lets
   the plan agent find other places the change affects, such as another doc
   that must say the same. Do not open follow-up issues. When the plan reports
   `too_large`, split the issue into parts. Add each part as a GitHub
   sub-issue of the parent, in order and in the parent's milestone. The parent
   closes when all parts are done.
4. **Implement.** The owner says go on the latest plan, and `/nexkit go` is
   posted. NexKit implements that plan and opens a pull request.
5. **Pull request.** Every round runs NexKit's checks and the AI review on the
   new commit. Merging needs both to pass.
6. **Fix.** Comment `/nexkit fix <instructions>` for another round. This also
   handles merge conflicts: NexKit merges `main` into the branch, it does not
   rebase. When a conflict needs a choice, the round stops as `blocked` with a
   question. Answer it with `/nexkit fix <decision>`. After a manual push,
   comment `/nexkit review`. If the review job itself fails with an error,
   `/nexkit review` retries it. If the review requests changes, NexKit starts
   automatic fix rounds up to the limit in its configuration. After that, a
   person decides on `/nexkit fix`.
7. **Merge.** NexKit squash-merges and starts CI on `main`. With `auto_merge`
   off, the owner squash-merges instead.
8. **Exceptions.** Changes whose purpose is to edit paths NexKit may not change
   are hand-made pull requests, as described under Decisions. A conflict in
   those paths, or a merge that brings workflow changes, is different: merge
   `origin/main` into the NexKit pull request branch by hand, in a separate
   worktree. Run build, lint and tests, ask the owner before pushing, then
   comment `/nexkit review`.

## The life of a milestone

1. **Break it down.** When the current milestone is nearly done, break the
   next one into issues, as the [roadmap](roadmap.md#how-work-is-planned)
   describes. Then check the [profiles](#profiles) against the concepts that
   the **From** column of [concepts.md](domain/concepts.md) lists for the new
   milestone, and against the models now available. Fix them in a hand-made
   pull request.
2. **Deliver the issues.** Each one follows the life of an issue above.
3. **Docs sweep.** Before the owner closes the milestone, one issue in it
   checks the docs and fixes what the milestone made stale. It checks at
   least:
   - the roadmap status of this milestone and the next one;
   - the **From** column of [concepts.md](domain/concepts.md) for every
     concept listed for this milestone, moved to a later milestone when the
     concept was not delivered;
   - every *(planned for Mx)* marker for this milestone in any doc, removed
     when the work was built and moved to a later milestone when it was not.
4. **Close.** The owner closes the milestone on GitHub once the docs sweep
   is merged.

## Keeping the docs current

- **The roadmap is the only place for milestone status.**
  [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) records each milestone's status and what it
  delivers. Other docs link to it instead of repeating it.
- **One marker for planned work.** Any doc text that describes something not
  built yet carries *(planned for Mx)*, where Mx is the milestone that builds
  it. This applies to every doc, not only the architecture. The docs sweep
  removes or moves these markers when a milestone closes.
- **No false statements left behind.** A change that makes any doc statement
  false fixes it in the same change. The rule is in the
  [AGENTS.md working rules](../AGENTS.md#working-rules), so the NexKit review
  applies it to every pull request.
- **Rules and reasons, not incident history.** Docs state each rule and why
  it exists. They do not retell incidents or cite issue or pull request
  numbers as examples. That history belongs in issues, pull requests and git.
  Links to decisions and doc sections stay, and so do links that track work,
  such as the roadmap's link to a GitHub milestone.

## Writing on GitHub

These rules apply to issues, plans, pull request descriptions and reviews.

- Lead with the point. Use short sentences and one idea per bullet.
- Say what changes in behaviour, and why, before naming classes or files.
- Put decisions and risks the owner must judge in their own short section.
- Keep implementation detail (signatures, SQL, file-by-file steps) out of the
  main text, or put it in a collapsed `<details>` block.
