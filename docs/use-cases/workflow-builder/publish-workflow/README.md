# Use case — Publish a workflow

> **Navigation**: [← Workflow Builder](../README.md) · [Use cases index](../README.md#use-cases)

## Purpose

Publish a workflow so that it can be triggered and executed.

## Primary actor

- Tenant Member with `workflow:definition:write`

## Trigger

- User initiates: publish a workflow

## Main flow

1. Actor starts the — Publish a workflow flow from the relevant Axis screen or API.
2. System checks tenant access, validates the request, and applies the documented acceptance criteria.
3. Actor sees the resulting data, confirmation, or actionable error for the flow.

## Alternate / error flows

- Validation failures and edge cases in Acceptance Criteria.

## Context

Users can create, view, edit, publish, archive, delete, and duplicate workflow definitions. A workflow definition is the blueprint the execution engine follows when triggered.

## Acceptance Criteria

*Happy path*
- [ ] Clicking "Publish" validates the workflow, moves it to `Active` status, and activates all configured triggers (e.g., registers cron job, generates webhook URL).
- [ ] A published workflow shows an "Active" badge and a "Run" button (if it has a Manual trigger).

*Validation & errors*
- [ ] Publishing fails if: the workflow has no steps beyond Start/End, has no trigger configured, or has any "broken" step (referencing a deleted form or model). A validation panel lists all issues.
- [ ] Publishing fails if any step has no outgoing transition (except End nodes).

*Edge cases*
- [ ] An already-published (Active) workflow can be edited — edits create a new Draft version. The current active version continues running until the new version is published.
- [ ] Publishing a new version archives the previous version's definition snapshot for execution history traceability.

*Out of scope*
- Approval workflow for publishing (e.g., requiring a second admin to approve).
