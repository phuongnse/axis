# Use case — View workflows list

> **Navigation**: [← Workflow Builder](../README.md) · [Use cases index](../README.md#use-cases)

## Purpose

See all workflows so that I can find and manage them.

## Primary actor

- Workspace Member with `workflow:definition:read`

## Trigger

- User initiates: see all workflows

## Main flow

1. Actor starts the — View workflows list flow from the relevant Axis screen or API.
2. System checks workspace access, validates the request, and applies the documented acceptance criteria.
3. Actor sees the resulting data, confirmation, or actionable error for the flow.

## Alternate / error flows

- Validation failures and edge cases in Acceptance Criteria.

## Context

Users can create, view, edit, publish, archive, delete, and duplicate workflow definitions. A workflow definition is the blueprint the execution engine follows when triggered.

## Acceptance Criteria

*Happy path*
- [ ] List shows: name, status badge (Draft / Active / Archived), trigger type icon, step count, last modified date, and last execution date.
- [ ] Default sort: last modified descending.
- [ ] Tabs or filter for status: All, Active, Draft, Archived.
- [ ] Search by name (real-time, client-side).

*Validation & errors*
- [ ] Empty state for each status tab has a contextual message (e.g., "No active workflows yet. Publish a workflow to activate it.").

*Edge cases*
- [ ] A workflow with multiple trigger types shows the first trigger's icon and a "+N" badge.

*Out of scope*
- Workflow folders / tags.
